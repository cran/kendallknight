Dear Professor Cook,
\bigskip

Please consider our article titled "Kendallknight: An R Package for Efficient Implementation of Kendall's Correlation Coefficient Computation" for publication in the R Journal.

The manuscript introduces the new package called `kendallknight` which provides examples on how to use interactive graphics in journal articles, and general tips for making an interesting contribution.

We believe the readers of the R Journal will find this article helpful for their work because it provides generally useful instructions that will work for many purposes.
